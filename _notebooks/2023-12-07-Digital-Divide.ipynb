    "\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "Diving into the digital divide highlighted disparities in internet access based on socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic factors. The visual elements, especially the code snippets, added an engaging dimension to the discussion. I really liked the visual elements of the code and how engaging it was.\n",
